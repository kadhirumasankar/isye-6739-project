	[X] Background and description of problem: Some detail of the problem, along with a description of the organization of what’s coming up in the remainder of the write-up
	[X] Main findings
		[X] Describe the problem at hand, and maybe provide a small literature review, if available
		[X] If you use simulation, develop and document your code. Anything from Excel to Matlab to Python is fine.  Show how to run your program(s).
		[X] Give illustrations of what you can learn from your work (e.g., whether or not a certain strategy will work better than others in blackjack).  Make sure to be statistically rigorous if you’re carrying out simulation experiments.
