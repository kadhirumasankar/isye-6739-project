Statistical analysis of games can be done by running many simulations. Statistics of interest can be recorded over many simulations, and when running thousands of such simulations, the estimations of statistics will begin to converge to the parameters' actual values. In this report, an analysis of the ``Coins in a Pot" game will be described (the rules of this game will be explained in the report). The expected value and distribution of the number of cycles that the game will last for will be found. The process that was followed to write the Python code to simulate the game will be detailed. Plots of the distribution at various timesteps and the movement of the mean of the distribution over many simulations will be shown. Finally, the importance of writing code and simulating games as opposed to doing calculations by hand will be discussed.
