\section{Conclusions}

In this lab, fracture tests were conducted on samples of 2024-T3 Aluminum. Data acquired during the fracture tests was processed to find the critical stress intensity factors, load v.s. displacement plots, and compliance for each sample. By computing these properties, it was found that increasing the thickness of the material reduced the average critical stress intensity, and also brought the $K_C$ value closer to $K_IC$. It was also found that the compliance values for the material were roughly within the same range.

Through this lab, the importance of fracture testing materials was demonstrated. Knowledge of fracture toughness is very important in industry as it will provide a lot of information about the suitability of a material for a specific use.
